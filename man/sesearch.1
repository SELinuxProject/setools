.SH NAME
sesearch \- SELinux policy query tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsesearch\fR [OPTIONS] [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] [POLICY]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsesearch\fR allows the user to search the rules in a SELinux policy.

.SH POLICY
.PP
A single file containing a binary policy. This file is usually named by version on Linux systems, for example, \fIpolicy.30\fR. This file is usually named \fIsepolicy\fR on Android systems.
If no policy file is provided, \fBsesearch\fR will search for the policy running on the current
system. If no policy can be found, \fBsesearch\fR will print an error message and exit.

.SH EXPRESSIONS
The user may specify an expression containing values for a given field(s) in a rule.
If no expression is specified or if none of the specified fields apply to a given rule type,
all rules of that type are considered to match the expression.

.SS Type Enforcement Rule Types
.IP "-A"
Find allow and allowxperm rules.
.IP "--allow"
Find allow rules.
.IP "--auditallow"
Find auditallow rules.
.IP "--dontaudit"
Find dontaudit rules.
.IP "--allowxperm"
Find allowxperm rules.
.IP "--auditallowxperm"
Find auditallowxperm rules.
.IP "--dontauditxperm"
Find dontauditxperm rules.
.IP "-T, --type_trans"
Find type_transition rules.
.IP "--type_member"
Find type_member rules.
.IP "--type_change"
Find type_change rules.

.SS RBAC Rule Types
.IP "--role_allow"
Find role allow rules.
.IP "--role_trans"
Find role_transition rules.
.IP "Note: TE/MLS rule searches cannot be mixed with RBAC rule searches"

.SS MLS Rule Types
.IP "--range_trans"
Find range_transition rules.

.SS Rule Fields
.IP "-s NAME, --source NAME"
Find rules with NAME as their source type/role.
.IP "-t NAME, --target NAME"
Find rules with NAME as their target type/role.
.IP "-D NAME, --default NAME"
Find rules with NAME as their default type/role/level.
.IP "-c NAME, --class NAME"
Find rules with NAME as their object class.
.IP "-p P1[,P2,...] --perm P1[,P2...]"
Find rules with at least one of the specified permissions.
Multiple permissions may be specified as a comma-separated list.
.IP "-b BOOL[,B2,...], --bool BOOL[,B2,...]"
Find conditional rules with the named Boolean in their conditional expression.
Multiple Booleans may be specified as a comma-separated list.
This option will include rules in both the true and false lists of the conditional.

.SS Search Options
The following additional options modify how the search is performed.
.IP "-ds"
A matching rule must have the specified source attribute/type/role explicitly, instead of matching by attribute contents.
.IP "-dt"
A matching rule must have the specified target attribute/type/role explicitly, instead of matching by attribute contents.
.IP "-eb"
A matching rule must have all specified Booleans, instead of matching any of the specified Boolean.
.IP "-ep"
A matching rule must have exactly the specified permissions, instead of matching any of the specified permission.
.IP "-ex"
A matching rule must have exactly the specified extended permissions, instead of matching any listed extended permission.
.IP "-Sp"
A matching rule must have permissions where are a superset of the specified permissions, instead of matching any of the permissions.
.IP "-rs"
Use regular expression for matching the source type/role.
.IP "-rt"
Use regular expression for matching the target type/role.
.IP "-rc"
Use regular expression for matching the object class.
.IP "-rd"
Use regular expression for matching the default type/role.
.IP "-rb"
Use regular expression for matching Booleans.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h, --help"
Print help information and exit.
.IP "--version"
Print version information and exit.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Print additional informational messages.
.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
List allow (and allowxperm) rules for accessing files labeled container_file_t from domains with attribute container_domain
# sesearch -A -s container_domain -t container_file_t -c file
List allow and dontaudit rules for accessing chr_files labeled container_file_t, that are controlled by boolean container_use_devices
# sesearch -A --dontaudit -t container_file_t -c chr_file -b container_use_devices
List dontaudit rules assigned via application_domain_type attribute (rules concerning specific types with that attribute are excluded)
# sesearch --dontaudit -s application_domain_type -ds
