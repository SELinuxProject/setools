.SH DESCRIPTION
Determine the differences between two SELinux policies.

.SH POLICY
.PP
A single file containing a binary policy. This file is usually named by version on Linux systems, for example, \fIpolicy.30\fR. This file is usually named \fIsepolicy\fR on Android systems.
If not provided, \fBsediff\fR will print an error message and exit.

.SH DIFFERENCES
.PP
.B
sediff
categorizes differences in policy elements into one of three forms.
.RS
.IP "added"
The element exists only in the modified policy.
.IP "removed"
The element exists only in the original policy.
.IP "modified"
The element exists in both policies but its semantic meaning has changed.
For example, a class is modified if one or more permissions are added or removed.
.RE
.PP

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
Show differences in boolean settings
# sediff -b /backup/policy.33 /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.33
Show statistics for allow and allowxperm rule changes (how many rules where added, removed, or modified)
#sediff -A --stats /backup/policy.33 /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.33
